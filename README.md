# Visualization project

This repository is for the visualization project I've done for the first semester. The project is to make an R Shiny dashboard used to analyse the dataset provided using interactive plots. The repository contains the files:
* `App.R` -> R script file containing the code for the dashboard.
* `IHMStefanini_industrial_safety_and_health_database_with_accidents_description.csv` -> The dataset on which the analysis is done.
* `RShiny Dashboard link.txt` -> The text file containing the link to the dashboard.
* `Visualization Project Report Code.Rmd` -> The R markdown file which contains the code to the report of the project.
* `Visualization Project Report.html` -> The html page version of the project report.
* `Visualization Project Report.pdf` -> The pdf of the project report.
